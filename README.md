# Template FitSM Service Portfolio / Catalogue

This repository is the template Service Protfolio / Catalogue repository that can be forked by each node, allowing each node to maintain their own service catalogue / portfolio. The repoistory can be forked, which will make an new repository onder the ownership of the node. The node itself can then maintain their own service catalogue / portfolio. 

Where a node choses to utilise Google docs for the service catalogue, a default link has been provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hUip36pfwKTUEbszoeuw13wtB1dwH5fW) for the core GDI WP4 / T4.2 directory for node documents. (03 - Pillars/WPs >  Pillar II > WP04 > T4.2 - European Operations > Node documents). 

NB: Documents contained within the GDI workspace are only accessible to GDI partners.
