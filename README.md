# Template FitSM Service Portfolio / Catalogue

This repository is the template Service Protfolio / Catalogue repository that can be forked by each participating county (recommended), updating the ownership of the new repositopry and hence allowing the owners to manage their own permissions. In FitSM the service catalogue should be public, however the service portfolio may be private. In case a country wants to use Google docs to maintain the service catalogue / portfolio, this option is detailed below however it is not recommended as access to the documents is limited to GDI participants, and the version tracking / control in Google docs is more limited. 

As each country may have one or more node(s) providing services listed in the catalogue / portfolio, each node should maintain their own service catalogue / portfolio as indicated in the first tab of the template spreadsheet. This means that there may be multiple spreadsheets required to detail all services, each maintained by a specific node, or a single spreadsheet maintained by one or more nodes collectively. 

Where a node choses to utilise Google docs for the service catalogue / portfolio, a default link has been provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hUip36pfwKTUEbszoeuw13wtB1dwH5fW) for the core GDI WP4 / T4.2 directory for node documents. (03 - Pillars/WPs >  Pillar II > WP04 > T4.2 - European Operations > MS documents). It is suggested that a country creates their own specific folder for the documents associated with the service catalogue / portfolio, and the node maintains their catalogue / portfolio within this folder. The default link provided above should then be updated to ensure that the service catalogue / protfolio for each country can be found from the comuntry specific repository. 

NB: Documents contained within the GDI workspace are only accessible to GDI partners.
